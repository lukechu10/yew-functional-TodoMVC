# Yew Functional TodoMVC

A simple todo app built using [`yew`](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) and `yew_functional`.

A live demo is available at: https://lukechu10.github.io/yew-functional-TodoMVC/  

## Build instructions

You need to have `rust`, [`trunk`](https://trunkrs.dev/) `nodejs` and `npm` installed to build this.

1. Install npm dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
2. Run `trunk`
    ```
    trunk build # --release
    ```

To start the `trunk` dev server, run `trunk serve` instead.
